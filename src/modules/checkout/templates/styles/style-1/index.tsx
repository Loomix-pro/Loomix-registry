/**
 * Guide for creating a new Checkout Template style
 * 
 * This component acts as the main form and layout for the checkout process.
 * If you intend to create a new style (e.g., style-3), you must consider the following:
 * 
 * 1. Received Data (Props):
 *    - `cart`: The current cart object (`HttpTypes.StoreCart`). It is required for the checkout 
 *      process. If it's missing, the component should return null or redirect.
 *    - `customer`: The currently logged-in customer (`HttpTypes.StoreCustomer`). This is passed 
 *      down to pre-fill address forms or save new addresses to the customer's account.
 * 
 * 2. Server-side Data Fetching:
 *    Because this is an async Server Component, it fetches required data before rendering:
 *    - `shippingMethods`: Fetched using the `cart.id`.
 *    - `paymentMethods`: Fetched using the `cart.region.id`.
 *    Both of these must be passed down to their respective child components.
 * 
 * 3. Checkout Steps & Components:
 *    The checkout flow is generally composed of the following sequential steps:
 *    - `Addresses`: Form for collecting shipping and billing addresses.
 *    - `Shipping`: Selection of the shipping method (requires `availableShippingMethods`).
 *    - `Payment`: Selection of the payment method (requires `availablePaymentMethods`).
 *    - `Review`: Final order review and the "Place Order" submit button.
 * 
 * 4. Customizing the Flow:
 *    You can rearrange these steps, merge them into a single-page accordion, or separate them 
 *    into multi-step wizards by customizing this wrapper and its child components inside 
 *    your style's `components` directory.
